# My Portfolio

Hey! Hola! Bonjour! Meseire! Ni Hao! Halo! Kedu!

Welcome to a piece of me that I've been taking the time to craft and will continue to. 

I want those who visit my site to be able to get a feel of who I am through my choice of colors, animations and graphics. 
Once you enter the portal, you're sent to the "About Me" page where you can learn some random things about me outside of being a developer. 
From there, you can head over to view some of my most recent projects that I've been working on over the past few months during 
my 12-month Fullstack Web Development Fellowship at Pursuit. You're able to check out the deployed sites (if available) and get linked 
to the code right here on Github. 

Besides my code, I wanted to make my site a bit more relaxed and add a bit of my photography. Hopefully, you enjoy the view as much as 
I loved putting it together. If you want to get in touch, defintely make your way over to the contact page where you can reach me 
via Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and Email. My resume is also linked there as well.
