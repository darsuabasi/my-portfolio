                                    of participating in a week long Hackathon during the month of February. Can you tell we were inspiring by the Black NYC culture?
                                    We wanted to created a fun way for people to learn more about Black culture because it is the BLUEPRINT. After winning Crowd Favorite
                                    during Demo Day, the only Award given, we as a team decided to make this bigger than just us. As of now, this game is in Beta Mode as 
                                    we plan on scaling the app so if you catch any bugs, don't hesitate to let us know or follow us on social media to keep up with updates.
                                    Till then, get your knowledge up, NYC style, Beta mode.
